# Image-Classification-

An Image classifier which predicts the identification of the person in the image.
In this project, I have downloaded random pictures from the internet of 5 celebrities: Lionel Messi, Virat Kohli, Maria Sharapova, Serene Williams & Roger Federer.
Using these as my dataset, this model works with an accuracy of 84.2%.
Then this model is deployed on a website which is in progress.
